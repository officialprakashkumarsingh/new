# AhamAI Coder - Critical Fixes & Enhancements

## ðŸš€ Issues Fixed and Improvements Made

### 1. **Fixed 500 Error in AI API Calls**
- **Problem**: AI API calls were failing with 500 status errors
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced error handling with specific error codes (429, 401, 500)
  - Added request timeout (30 seconds) to prevent hanging
  - Improved request headers with User-Agent and Accept headers
  - Added better JSON response validation
  - Implemented comprehensive exception handling for network issues

### 2. **Enhanced Repository Banner Design**
- **Problem**: Banner was too simple and didn't show running status
- **Solution**:
  - Removed icon from banner as requested
  - Added "AhamAI Coder" text with proper styling (Pacifico font)
  - Added gradient background (white to light grey)
  - Implemented "Start Coding" button with black/white gradient
  - Added real-time "RUNNING" status indicator in red when AI is active
  - Enhanced visual appeal with better shadows and padding

### 3. **Real-time Status Tracking & Background Processing**
- **Problem**: AI stopped when UI was closed, no real-time updates
- **Solution**:
  - Added `isAIRunning` and `aiStatus` ValueNotifiers to GitHub service
  - AI processing continues even when bottom sheet is closed
  - Real-time status updates across all UI components
  - Banner shows running status when AI is active
  - Proper cleanup and state management with `mounted` checks

### 4. **Advanced File Search & Analysis (Cursor AI-like)**
- **Problem**: Simple keyword matching was inefficient
- **Solution**:
  - Multi-dimensional file scoring system
  - Parallel processing for better performance
  - Smart keyword extraction with stop-word filtering
  - File extension prioritization
  - Function and class name detection
  - Semantic scoring for common patterns (error handling, UI components)
  - Relevance-based ranking (top 30 most relevant files)

### 5. **Intelligent Context Extraction**
- **Problem**: Basic context extraction missed important code sections
- **Solution**:
  - Advanced context extraction with logical boundaries
  - Class and function definition detection
  - Smart context sizing based on code patterns
  - Imports and structure extraction as fallback
  - Multi-section context with clear separators
  - Prevents duplicate context extraction

### 6. **Enhanced Activity Log with Terminal-like UI**
- **Problem**: Basic activity log was not visually appealing
- **Solution**:
  - Dark terminal-like background (#1E1E1E)
  - Color-coded log entries (red for errors, green for success, blue for processing)
  - Real-time status updates in header
  - Activity counter badge
  - Animated loading indicators
  - Improved typography with JetBrains Mono font

### 7. **Better Error Handling & Network Resilience**
- **Problem**: Poor error messages and network failure handling
- **Solution**:
  - Specific error messages for different failure types
  - Network timeout handling
  - JSON parsing error protection
  - Socket exception handling
  - User-friendly error descriptions
  - Debug logging for troubleshooting

### 8. **Performance Optimizations**
- **Problem**: Slow file processing and UI freezing
- **Solution**:
  - Parallel file processing with Future.wait()
  - Reduced file scanning from 50 to 30 most relevant files
  - Optimized regex patterns and string operations
  - Better memory management with proper disposal
  - Efficient activity log scrolling

### 9. **Real-time UI Updates & State Management**
- **Problem**: UI not updating in real-time during AI processing
- **Solution**:
  - Multiple ValueNotifier listeners for different states
  - Proper mounted checks to prevent memory leaks
  - Animated state transitions
  - Background processing with UI continuity
  - Real-time progress indicators

### 10. **Advanced AI Prompt Processing**
- **Problem**: Basic prompt handling with poor context
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced system prompts for better AI responses
  - Temperature and max_tokens optimization
  - Better context formatting with clear sections
  - Improved prompt engineering for code modifications
  - Fallback handling for empty responses
